# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects
Welcome to my repository of Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects! This repository contains a collection of projects that I have completed in the field of data science, with a focus on machine learning and deep learning.

## About Me
I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer with a passion for using data to solve complex problems. I have experience working with a variety of machine learning models and deep learning architectures, and I'm always looking to learn more about the latest developments in the field.

## Projects
The projects in this repository showcase some of my work in the areas of machine learning and deep learning. Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a detailed README file with information about the project, including the problem statement, dataset, model architecture, and results.

Here's a list of the projects in this repository:

Project 1: Classification of Images using Convolutional Neural Networks
Project 2: Predicting House Prices using Regression Models
Project 3: Natural Language Processing with LSTM Networks
Project 4: Credit Risk Modelling using Ensemble Techniques

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-projects.git

Each project is contained in its own directory, so you can navigate to the directory of the project you're interested in and follow the instructions in the README file to get started.
